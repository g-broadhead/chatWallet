# Motivation

The primary use of a chat room is to share information via text with a group of other users that share the same interest. Chat rooms provide a location for users to meet online and discuss topics ranging from hobbies to school work. The idea of our chatroom app is to boost productivity among users that use the chat room for work and education and the chance to meet new people with the same hobbies for similar interests. Chat rooms can offer the opportunity to get new perspectives from around the world and it is free and easy to use.

# How to Use Chat Wallet

We have created an app that will allow the user to pick a certain topic to chat with other users about. When the user enters the site they will be prompted with a log in button and a sign up button. If the user has an account, they can simply put in their username and password. If the user does not have an account they will need to sign up using an email, username, password, and date of birth. Once they are pass the log in or sign up page, they will be directed to a page where the user can choose a room they want to enter. Once they have choosen a room, they are directed to the chat room page on the topic the user chose. They are able to chat with other users that are in the same chat room. Once the users are finished chatting in the chat room, the user can leave the chat room by clicking the leave button.
